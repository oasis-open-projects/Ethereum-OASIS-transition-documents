Archived content relating to the transition of the Ethereum-OASIS Open Project to EEA Community Projects Managed Open Project.

# Background

On June 29, 2021, the Ethereum-OASIS Open Project (https://github.com/ethereum-oasis) was renamed EEA Community Projects Managed Open Project (https://github.com/eea-oasis).

This resulted in a series of changes to the assets of the project, particularly the existing store of i-CLA signatures collected by the CLA Assistant. Chet Ensign and Claudia Rausch saved background information to retain a snapshot of the project assets prior to the transition. 

This repository is intended to a place to collect this historical data or links to external artifacts. 

1) https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/29-06-2021-oasis-open-project - Pointer to a forked copy of the administrative and governance related repository for the Ethereum OASIS Open Project just before the organization name was changed. Claudia uploaded copies of the subscribers to the existing mailing lists before forking the copy.

We do not have the list of Etherum-OASIS organization members as I could not download them. We also do not have the audit log as there is no evident way to download more than a few days worth of entries.
